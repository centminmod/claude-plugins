## v1.26.0 — 2026-04-28

### Observational subagent-cost framing — share, coverage, within-session split, warm-up signals

Builds on v1.7.0 Phase-B parent-prompt attribution to answer the question "what fraction of my session went to subagents, and how should I read that number?". Render-time only — no parser changes, no `_SCRIPT_VERSION` bump, parse cache stays valid.

### What's new

**Headline `Subagent share of cost` card** — top-of-report KPI in HTML (single + instance) and a row in the MD summary table. Reads `sum(attributed_subagent_cost) / totals.cost` and renders as `X% ($Y of $Z) across N spawns`. Branches on `--include-subagents`:
- on, with attributed turns: shows the share, with `lower bound — N orphan turns excluded` when `subagent_attribution_summary.orphan_subagent_turns > 0`.
- on, no subagent activity: `0% — no subagent activity`.
- off: `attribution disabled — re-run with --include-subagents` (avoids the deceptive 0% reading the previous default would have produced).

**Attribution coverage block** — small section under the by-subagent table that surfaces what was previously buried in `subagent_attribution_summary`: orphan turn count, cycles detected, max nesting depth, and spawn → attributed-turn fanout. Frames the headline as observational signal, not a precise measurement.

**Within-session spawning split** — per-session table comparing median *combined* turn cost (parent direct + attributed subagent) on spawning vs. non-spawning turns. Renders only for sessions with ≥3 turns in each bucket. Holds task / model / context constant within a session, but is explicitly labelled descriptive — selection bias remains because users delegate the hardest sub-tasks. *Not* a counterfactual estimate.

**Warm-up columns in `by_subagent_type`**:
- `First-turn %` — median across invocations of `first_turn.cost_usd / total_invocation_cost`. High = short-lived agents pay setup tax without amortising.
- `SP amortised %` — fraction of invocations whose turn ≥2 read from cache (system-prompt cache write paid back at least once).
- Visible only when `--include-subagents` is on AND at least one invocation was observed.

**Per-prompt badge** — appended `(NN% of combined cost)` to the existing `+N subagents` annotation. Labelled "combined", not "of turn", because the visible Cost column shows direct cost only; "% of turn" would mathematically imply the parent was 37% of itself.

### Honesty notes baked into the surfaces

- "Share" is used everywhere instead of "overhead" — overhead implies the cost would otherwise be unpaid, exactly the unanswered counterfactual.
- The headline is documented as a lower bound whenever orphans exist.
- The within-session split's body text states explicitly that descriptive correlation is *not* a counterfactual estimate.
- The synthetic-A/B benchmark and analytical crossover calculator are deferred to follow-ups; this release does not pretend to answer the causal "did delegating cost more" question.

### What changed in code

- `_empty_subagent_row` gains `invocation_count`, `first_turn_share_pct`, `sp_amortisation_pct`.
- `_build_by_subagent_type` groups subagent turns by `subagent_agent_id` per-invocation and rolls per-invocation metrics up to type rows. Aggregation is at report-build time, not per-turn — no parse-cache schema change.
- New helpers: `_compute_subagent_share`, `_compute_within_session_split`, `_compute_instance_subagent_share`, `_median`, `_build_subagent_share_card_html`, `_build_attribution_coverage_html`, `_build_within_session_split_html`, `_build_subagent_share_md`, `_build_within_session_split_md`.
- `_build_report` precomputes `subagent_share_stats` + `subagent_within_session_split` and stashes them on the report dict so JSON/CSV/MD/HTML all see the same values.
- `_build_instance_report` aggregates per-project shares and runs the within-session split over the flattened `all_sessions_out`. Instance report now propagates `include_subagents`.
- `render_html`, `render_md`, `_render_instance_html`, `_render_instance_md` updated.
- CSV `by_subagent_type` block gains `invocation_count`, `first_turn_share_pct`, `sp_amortisation_pct` columns.
- 8 new tests in `tests/test_session_metrics.py`. Existing 506 tests remain green.

### Known limitations

- The headline relies on Phase-B attribution; orphan rate matters. On a real session during manual verification, 45 of ~150 subagent turns were orphans (chains the three-pass linkage couldn't resolve back to a root prompt) — the share was clearly disclosed as a lower bound.
- The within-session split has within-session selection bias and does not replace a synthetic A/B test for the causal question.
- The compression-ratio signal (parent `tool_result` payload size vs. subagent gross spend) was considered but deferred — would require a parser change to capture `tool_result` text length and bump `_SCRIPT_VERSION`.

## v1.25.1 — 2026-04-28

### Bug fix — `iterations:null` crash when advisor is not enabled

`<synthetic>` resume-marker turns written by environments where the advisor feature
is not active (e.g. the desktop app) emit `"iterations": null` in the usage dict
rather than omitting the key. `u.get("iterations", [])` returns `None` when the key
exists with a null value, causing `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` in
`_cost` and `_advisor_info` whenever a project-scope run included those sessions.

- Replace `u.get("iterations", [])` with `u.get("iterations") or []` in both
  `_cost` and `_advisor_info`. Handles absent, null, and valid-list cases identically.

---

## v1.25.0 — 2026-04-28

### Advisor turn support — cost correction + surface

The Claude Code Advisor (`advisor()` tool) runs a second model against the full conversation
transcript. Its tokens were previously hidden in `usage.iterations[]` and not counted, causing
advisor turns to be silently under-priced by up to 6.6×.

- **Cost correction**: `_cost()` now reads `usage.iterations[type=="advisor_message"]` and
  bills advisor tokens at the advisor model's list rates. The corrected `cost_usd` propagates
  to all session/project/instance aggregates.
- **New per-turn fields**: `advisor_calls`, `advisor_cost_usd`, `advisor_model`,
  `advisor_input_tokens`, `advisor_output_tokens`.
- **Session field**: `advisor_configured_model` from the top-level `advisorModel` JSONL field.
- **Content classification**: `server_tool_use` → letter `v`; `advisor_tool_result` → letter `R`.
  `"advisor"` appears in tool names and the drawer tools list.
- **Dashboard card**: "Advisor calls" (amber badge, auto-hidden when unused).
- **Session table**: amber annotation/badge in `--project-cost` HTML and text output.
- **CLI footer**: `Advisor calls : N call(s)  +$X.XXXX` when advisor was used.
- **Per-turn drawer**: cost section shows Primary / Advisor / Cost breakdown; TOKENS section
  shows Advisor input / Advisor output rows. Both hidden on non-advisor turns.
- **Schema docs** (`references/jsonl-schema.md`): four new fields documented.
- Graceful degradation — sessions without advisor activity produce identical output.

## v1.24.0 — 2026-04-28

### Fix: `file_reread` classification accuracy

- First access in any context segment no longer flagged as a wasteful re-read (only the
  2nd+ read in the same segment counts).
- Subagent-boundary re-reads (model switch or session resume) are now shown as informational
  — no ⚠ badge — because accessing files in a fresh context is expected and unavoidable.
- Drawer explanation splits into two branches: cross-context reads get tips on `offset`/`limit`;
  same-context re-reads get tips on `Grep` / `Read` with offsets.
- `_BASH_PATH_RE` extended-allowlist: hidden directories (`.claude`, `.git`) no longer produce
  false path entries in the classification detail.

## v1.23.0 — 2026-04-28

### Turn Character section in every turn drawer + cross-browser overflow fix

- Clicking any timeline row now shows a "Turn Character" section in the detail drawer with a
  colour-coded classification label and a one-sentence explanation derived from that turn's
  actual token data (file basenames, cache percentages, block counts, etc.).
- Fixed the ⚠ risk badge overflowing outside the timeline cell in Opera and other non-Chromium
  browsers.

## v1.22.0 — 2026-04-28

### 9-category turn waste classification

Classifies every assistant turn into one of: `productive`, `retry_error`, `file_reread`,
`oververbose_edit`, `dead_end`, `cache_payload`, `extended_thinking`, `subagent_dispatch`,
or `normal`.

- Turn Character column in the HTML timeline with colour-coded labels and ⚠ risk badges.
- Stacked-bar chart in the dashboard (waste distribution by session).
- Drill-down cards per waste category with turn count, token share, and examples.
- `turn_character` / `turn_risk` fields in JSON and CSV output.

## v1.21.0 — 2026-04-27

### Four inline markers in the HTML detail timeline

- Idle-gap dividers: slate pill `▮ N min idle` between turns when wall-clock gap ≥ threshold
  (`--idle-gap-minutes`, default 10; set 0 to disable).
- Model-switch dividers: cyan pill `⇄ Model: prev → cur` when the model changes mid-session.
- Truncated-response badge: orange `✂ truncated` on `max_tokens` turns + dashboard KPI card.
- Cache-break inline badge: amber `⚡` on turns that invalidate the prompt cache.

`stop_reason` and `is_cache_break` added as CSV columns.

## v1.20.1 — 2026-04-27

### Fix: spurious skill-tag badge after context compaction

Context-compaction summaries contain verbatim prior-session text including slash-command XML
tags. These were producing a false badge on the first post-compaction turn. Fixed by detecting
the compaction sentinel and skipping slash-command extraction for those entries.

## v1.20.0 — 2026-04-27

### Skill/slash-command badge in HTML timeline model column

When a turn was triggered by a skill invocation or slash command (e.g. `session-metrics`), a
small purple badge appears inline in the timeline. The turn drawer also shows a "Skill" row.

## v1.19.0 — 2026-04-26

### Per-turn latency + session wall-clock

- `latency_seconds` per turn: wall-clock seconds from preceding user entry to the assistant
  response.
- `wall_clock_seconds` per session (first user prompt → last assistant).
- Markdown summary gains `Wall clock` and `Mean turn latency` rows.
- `--compare-run-prompt-steering` wrapper for prompt-steering sweeps via `--compare-run`.

## v1.18.2 — 2026-04-25

### Fix: Console theme turn drawer transparent background

## v1.18.1 — 2026-04-25

### Fix: cache-breaks/skills/subagents sections duplicated in detail.html

The cross-cutting summary sections (cache breaks, skills, subagents) now appear only in the
dashboard page, not in both the dashboard and the detail page.

## v1.18.0 — 2026-04-25

### `--include-subagents` on by default

Subagent JSONL files are now included in session reports automatically. Opt out with
`--no-include-subagents`. Also fixes the subagent hint label in the Insights dashboard card.

## v1.17.1 — 2026-04-25

### Fix: cache-breaks section unstyled in non-default themes

Cache-break section elements now have correct colours across all four themes (Beacon, Console,
Lattice, Pulse).

## v1.17.0 — 2026-04-25

### Subagent → parent-prompt token attribution

Maps every subagent turn's tokens back to the originating user prompt via a three-stage
linkage chain (`tool_use.id → prompt_anchor → agent_id → root`).

- HTML prompts table sorts by `cost_usd + attributed_subagent_cost` by default — the "what
  action cost the most" lens.
- "Subagents +$" column and "+N subagents" row badge auto-appear when attribution is present.
- `--sort-prompts-by {total,self}` and `--no-subagent-attribution` flags.
- Three new CSV columns: `attributed_subagent_tokens`, `attributed_subagent_cost`,
  `attributed_subagent_count`.

## v1.16.0 — 2026-04-25

### Cross-cutting sections: cache breaks, skills & slash commands, subagent summary

Four new summary sections in the HTML dashboard for every session / project export:
cache-break cost analysis, skill/slash-command invocation table, and subagent type breakdown.
`--cache-break-threshold N` (default 500 tokens) controls the minimum re-fill size to report.

## v1.15.2 — 2026-04-25

### 10 additional model pricing entries + regex/prefix matching tier

Extended `_PRICING` with 10 more models. Prefix matching covers entire model families without
requiring exact `model_id` entries. Stderr advisory emitted for truly unknown models.

## v1.15.1 — 2026-04-25

### Non-Claude model pricing: GLM, Gemma 4, Qwen 3.5

Correct per-token rates for GLM-4.7 / GLM-5 / GLM-5.1 (Z.ai), Gemma 4 (Google / Ollama
local variants), and Qwen 3.5:9b. Prevents silent Sonnet-rate mis-attribution on mixed-model
sessions.

## v1.15.0 — 2026-04-24

### 4-theme picker embedded in every HTML export

All four themes (Beacon, Console, Lattice, Pulse) are embedded in every generated HTML file.
Users switch at view-time via a top-nav button strip; choice persists across Dashboard↔Detail
and instance→project drill-down links via URL hash + localStorage. Console is the default.
Also: 25% font size increase, Highcharts bundle gated to single-page variant only.

## v1.14.1 — 2026-04-23

### Fix: instance dashboard chart shows real token breakdowns

Instance daily chart now shows stacked input/output/cache-read/cache-write token breakdown per
day (was showing cost-only bars). Day axis label added.

## v1.14.0 — 2026-04-22

### Instance-level "all projects" dashboard

`--all-projects` generates a single dashboard aggregating every project under your Claude Code
install. Summary cards, daily cost timeline, projects table (sorted by cost, with clickable
drilldown links to per-project dashboards), and reused weekly/punchcard/time-of-day insights.
`--no-project-drilldown` fast path, `--projects-dir PATH` override for custom installs.
Output lands in `exports/session-metrics/instance/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/`.

## v1.13.1 — 2026-04-22

### Fix: `_resolve_tz` docstring correction

Corrected internal docstring that incorrectly described an `Intl.DateTimeFormat` implementation.

## v1.13.0 — 2026-04-22

### IFEval paired-samples statistics: McNemar test + Wilson CI

`--compare` HTML report gains a statistical significance table: McNemar χ² + p-value and
Wilson 95% CI for each IFEval pass-rate comparison. Small-N banner suppresses stats when
fewer than 6 paired samples are available.

## v1.12.0 — 2026-04-22

### `--strict-tz` flag + Windows tzdata hint

`--strict-tz` exits with a clear error when the system's zoneinfo database cannot resolve the
requested IANA timezone (the default is lenient — falls back to UTC). On Windows, an advisory
hints to install the `tzdata` pip package when `ZoneInfo` fails to load.

## v1.11.3 — 2026-04-21

### Audit Tier 3 fixes: test hygiene + cost note

Added a comment inside `_cost()` pointing to the fast-mode 6× multiplier caveat in
`references/pricing.md`. Test temp-directory randomisation and `atexit` contract pin.

## v1.11.2 — 2026-04-21

### Audit Tier 2 hardening: contract pin

`atexit` advisory handler is now registered at module load time (not lazily), so it fires even
in early-exit paths.

## v1.11.1 — 2026-04-21

### Audit Tier 1 hardening + `--allow-unverified-charts` flag

- Theme-aware drawer backdrop, `<meta name="chart-lib">` in every HTML export, `@media print`
  hide rules for cleaner PDF output.
- Unknown-model `stderr` advisory at process exit (lists models that fell through to Sonnet
  default pricing).
- Fast-mode `stderr` advisory with count of `usage.speed == "fast"` turns.
- `--compare`, `--compare-prep`, `--compare-run`, `--count-tokens-only` are now mutually
  exclusive via argparse group.
- `--allow-unverified-charts` opt-in to skip Highcharts vendor SHA-256 check for offline
  workflows.

## v1.11.0 — 2026-04-21

### Clickable per-turn timeline rows with full detail drawer

Every row in the HTML detail timeline is now clickable. Clicking opens a right-side sliding
drawer showing: turn metadata (model, cost, tokens, stop reason), prompt text, all tool calls
with input previews, and a linked prompts table. Keyboard-accessible (Enter/Escape).

## v1.10.0 — 2026-04-20

### Custom prompt commands in SKILL.md

SKILL.md dispatch extended with custom prompt-command rows so Claude routes natural-language
requests like "compare these two sessions" or "run a headless compare" to the correct flags
without ambiguity. README updated with command examples.

## v1.9.0 — 2026-04-20

### `--compare-run` headless automation

`--compare-run` spawns two `claude -p` sessions headlessly, feeds each one the same prompt
suite, and then calls `--compare` on the resulting JSONLs — a single command for an end-to-end
A/B model benchmark. `[1m]` default effort prefix added to prompt suite entries.

## v1.8.0 — 2026-04-20

### Session-resume detection: `claude -c` and terminal-exit markers

Detects two resume patterns in the JSONL: the `<synthetic>` model marker (auto-continuation
after context limit) and the `/exit` + re-open pattern (manual terminal-exit resume). Both are
surfaced as timeline dividers and counted in the dashboard "Session resumes" card. Terminal
exits are visually distinguished from normal resumes.

## v1.7.1 — 2026-04-19

### Subagent-related fixes

Minor UI fixes to subagent display in the dashboard and timeline.

## v1.7.0 — 2026-04-19

### `--compare` two-session A/B comparison (Phases 1–9 + trigger hardening)

`session-metrics --compare A.jsonl B.jsonl` produces a paired comparison: side-by-side token/
cost/cache metrics, IFEval-style pass-rate evaluation (sentinel-tagged prompt suite, 10 built-in
predicates), paired-turn table, quality-vs-cost verdict, and a shareable single-page HTML
report. Also includes `--compare-prep` to generate a canonical prompt suite, and
`--count-tokens-only` (API-key path) to estimate token counts before running.

Three-layer trigger discipline: argparse mutex, SKILL.md `$ARGUMENTS[0]` dispatch gate, and
description-level LLM guard prevent accidental invocation on unrelated prompts.

## v1.6.0 — 2026-04-19

### `/usage`-style Usage Insights panel on the dashboard

New dashboard section mirroring the data Claude Code's `/usage` command surfaces: total spend,
cache efficiency, model breakdown, top-sessions table, and conditional insight cards
(model-compare nudge, fast-mode advisory, etc.). Threshold-gated so cards only appear when the
data is meaningful.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-04-18

### Resume-marker cost tracking

Session-resume markers now carry a token/cost estimate for the context re-fill cost incurred
by resuming the conversation. Surfaced in the dashboard card and timeline divider subtitle.

## v1.4.1 — 2026-04-18

### Fix: terminal-exit marker visually distinguished from resume marker

The dashboard card correctly reported "2 resumes · 1 terminal exit" but the timeline dividers
were rendering all three as identical "↻ Session resumed" pills. Terminal-exit markers now
render with a distinct visual style (`⊠ Session ended`) so both surfaces tell a consistent
story.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-04-18

### Session-resume detection (initial)

Detects `claude -c` resumes via the `/exit` + `<synthetic>` fingerprint and surfaces resume
events in the dashboard and HTML timeline.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-04-18

### Content-block distribution (Proposal B) + streaming-dedup fix

Per-turn and aggregate counts for `thinking`, `tool_use`, `text`, `tool_result`, and `image`
content blocks. HTML Content column with compact letter encoding and tooltips. Extended-thinking
and Tool-calls dashboard cards. CSV gains five new block-count columns.

Fix: multi-entry streaming messages were losing all but the last content block. `_extract_turns`
now unions blocks across all occurrences of the same `message.id`.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-18

### Ephemeral cache TTL drilldown (Proposal A) — pricing accuracy

Splits `cache_creation_input_tokens` into 5-minute and 1-hour buckets and prices each at its
correct Anthropic rate. Previously all cache writes were charged at the 5m rate, causing
up to 60% undercount of the cache-write component for sessions that used 1-hour TTL.

HTML: TTL badge on CacheWr cells. Text/MD: `*` suffix on affected cells. CSV/JSON: three new
per-turn fields. Dashboard: Cache TTL mix card.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-04-18

### uPlot + Chart.js MIT-licensed chart alternatives

`--chart-lib {highcharts,uplot,chartjs,none}`. uPlot (~45 KB, MIT) and Chart.js (~70 KB, MIT)
are fully vendored with SHA-256 manifest verification. Use `--chart-lib uplot` for a fully
MIT-licensed export; `--chart-lib none` for a zero-JS archive.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-04-17

### First stable release

- Per-turn token/cost/cache breakdown across 5-hour session blocks.
- Multi-format export: text, JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML (2-page dashboard + detail).
- Usage insights: weekly roll-up, session duration + burn rate, hour-of-day punchcard,
  weekday × hour heatmap, 5-hour session-block analysis.
- Vendored Highcharts (`--chart-lib highcharts`) with SHA-256 integrity check.
- Parse cache (`~/.cache/session-metrics/`) for fast re-analysis of unchanged JSONLs.
- Input validation, path containment, timezone support (`--tz`, `--utc-offset`).
- Pricing table covers claude-opus-4-7 / sonnet-4-6 / haiku-4-5 + historical models.
